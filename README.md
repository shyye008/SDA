# SDA
R codes for the manuscript "High-dimensional Statistical Inference and Variable Selection Using Sufficient Dimension Association"

The file "SDA.R" contains four R functions: "SDA" outputs the SDA-KS and SDA-CvM test statistics and the corresponding critical values; "SDA_chi" outputs the SDA_chi test statistic and the corresponding p-value; "SDA_knock" outputs the feature statistics CvMCD-SDA and CvMSM-SDA for multiple hypothesis testing; "Output" outputs the empirical FDP and power for a given desired FDR level.

The file "Simulation.R" contains R codes to illustrate the use of R functions in "SDA.R" and to replicate part of the simulation results presented in the paper.
